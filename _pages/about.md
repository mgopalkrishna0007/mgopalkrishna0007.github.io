I am a Visiting Research Student at the [iDARE Laboratory](https://ece.iisc.ac.in/~debdeeps/), Department of Electrical Communication Engineering, [Indian Institute of Science (IISc) Bangalore](https://iisc.ac.in/), under the supervision of [Prof. Debdeep Sarkar](https://eecs.iisc.ac.in/people/debdeep-sarkar/). I am also pursuing my undergraduate studies in [Electrical Engineering at Delhi Technological University (DTU)](https://dtu.ac.in/).

My research interests include Computational Electromagnetics, Optimization & Inverse design of Metasurface, FSS, Artificial Magnetic Conductors and RF circuits. Currently I am working on MEEP based FDTD and Electromagnetic Modelling using Physics Informed DeepONets. My previous experience include Radar Systems, Signal Processing for Vital Signs Estimation and hardware driven clutter suppression.

In addition, I serve as an Avionics and Radar Systems Technician with Team [UAS-DTU](https://uasdtu.com/), where I contributed to radar-based vital signs estimation using FMCW and UWB radars for outdoor triaging applications with a 2-meter standoff. As the only Asian team to qualify, we achieved 2nd place globally among self-funded teams, earning a US $60,000 cash prize and ranking in the top five overall at the [DARPA Triage Challenge – Year 1](https://www.darpa.mil/research/challenges/darpa-triage-challenge), where I contributed as systems engineer and developed Python APIs for Texas Instruments radar sensors for vital sign estimation, tracking and related pipeline.

In Year 2, we again secured 2nd place in the Systems category, winning US $150,000 at the event held in Georgia, USA, competing alongside institutions such as Carnegie Mellon University, the University of Pennsylvania, and the University of Maryland. My work focused on Hankel Dynamic Mode Decomposition and tracking for respiratory data using UWB pulsed coherent radars, which was published at [NeurIPS 2025](https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2025). This work was also presented in [Learning2Sense Workshop](https://neurips.cc/virtual/2025/loc/san-diego/workshop/109563) at [NeurIPS 2025](https://neurips.cc/virtual/2025/loc/san-diego/workshop/109563), where we received the [Best Poster Award](https://suhani92.github.io/HDMD-Respiratory-Rate/).
