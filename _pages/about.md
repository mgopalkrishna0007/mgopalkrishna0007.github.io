I am a Visiting Research Student at the [iDARE Laboratory](https://ece.iisc.ac.in/~debdeeps/), Department of Electrical Communication Engineering, [Indian Institute of Science (IISc) Bangalore](https://iisc.ac.in/), under the supervision of [Prof. Debdeep Sarkar](https://eecs.iisc.ac.in/people/debdeep-sarkar/).

I am also pursuing my undergraduate studies in [Electrical Engineering at Delhi Technological University (DTU)](https://dtu.ac.in/).

My research interests include **radar systems**, **signal processing for vital signs estimation**, **metasurfaces**, and **computational electromagnetics**. Currently, my work focuses on **metasurface-based inverse design for filter applications** and **hardware-driven clutter suppression**.

In addition, I serve as an **Avionics and Radar Systems Technician** with [Team UAS-DTU](https://uasdtu.com/), where I contributed to radar-based vital signs estimation using **FMCW** and **UWB** radars for outdoor triaging applications with a 2-meter standoff.

As the only Asian team to qualify, we achieved **2nd place globally among self-funded teams**, earning a **US \$60,000** cash prize and ranking in the **top five overall** at the [DARPA Triage Challenge (Year 1)](https://www.darpa.mil/research/challenges/darpa-triage-challenge). In **Year 2**, we again secured **2nd place in the Systems category**, winning **US \$150,000** at the event held in **Georgia, USA**, competing alongside institutions such as **Carnegie Mellon University**, **the University of Pennsylvania**, and **the University of Maryland**.
